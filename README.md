**Project Overview: Crypto & Stocks**

In this project, we conduct an in-depth analysis of cryptocurrency and stock market data. We explore various aspects including volatility, social media sentiment (pending due to API issues), correlation, and risk. Additionally, we apply machine learning techniques to predict cryptocurrency prices.

Selected Cryptocurrencies:

Binance Coin (BNB)
Bitcoin (BTC)
Cardano (ADA)
Ethereum (ETH)
Polkadot (DOT)
Ripple (XRP)
Solana (SOL)
Analysis Topics:

Volatility: We analyze the volatility of different cryptocurrencies to identify which ones exhibit the highest and lowest volatility.
Social Media & Sentiment: While there are ongoing challenges with accessing social media data via APIs, we aim to incorporate sentiment analysis from social media platforms to understand its impact on cryptocurrency trends.
Correlation & Risk: We examine correlations between different cryptocurrencies and traditional financial assets to assess risk levels and potential diversification benefits.
Machine Learning Models:

LSTM Model for Bitcoin: We implement a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict Bitcoin prices based on historical data.
Random Forest Classifier: Using a Random Forest classifier, we aim to classify cryptocurrency price movements or trends.
Linear Regression: We employ Linear Regression to model the relationship between various factors and cryptocurrency prices.
Key Questions Addressed:

Average Age of Top 10 Coins: We determine the average age of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
Volatility Analysis: We identify the most volatile and stable cryptocurrencies based on historical price movements.
Predictive Modeling: Can machine learning accurately predict the closing price of selected cryptocurrencies?
Fluctuation Rate: What is the rate of price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies over specific time intervals?
Comparison with Broader Market: How do cryptocurrencies compare to traditional financial markets in terms of performance and volatility?
By addressing these questions, we aim to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of cryptocurrency markets and their interactions with traditional financial instruments.
