**Project Overview: Cryptocurrency Analysis**

Introduction
- Welcome to our Data Science Project for the "Seminar Topics in FinTech" course at Erasmus University Rotterdam. This project delves into the vibrant and constantly evolving world of cryptocurrencies. We are committed to analyzing extensive historical data on major digital currencies and comparing these with traditional financial indices like the S&P 500. Our aim is to provide deep insights into market trends and asset behaviors, enhancing our understanding of this dynamic financial landscape.

Crypto Price Prediction Using Wikipedia Sentiment
- Our innovative approach includes forecasting future Bitcoin prices by integrating historical price data with sentiment analysis derived from Wikipedia edit histories. This method focuses on seven key cryptocurrencies, aiming to gauge public sentiment's impact on market movements.

Machine Learning Application
- We employ sophisticated machine learning models to predict future movements in the cryptocurrency market. These tools are designed to offer valuable insights to stakeholders in both the academic and financial sectors, guiding decisions and strategies in cryptocurrency investments.

Contact and Collaboration
- We encourage collaboration and are open to discussion regarding our methodologies or results. For any inquiries or further discussion, please reach out via our project email: 597963mr@eur.nl.


**Data Collection**

The datasets employed in this project include:

- Crypto Historical Data: Performance metrics for various cryptocurrencies.
- S&P 500 Historical Data: Historical data points of the S&P 500 index to compare with cryptocurrency performance.
- CSV Files: Detailed files containing fields such as Coin Name, Symbol, Date, High, Low, Open, Close, Volume, and Market Cap.

**Analysis Process**

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
   
Our exploratory process covers several key analyses:

- Price Analysis: Examination of historical price changes.
- Volatility Study: Measurement of price fluctuation levels across different cryptocurrencies.
- Outlier Detection: Identification of anomalies within the data.
- Correlation and Risk Assessment: Evaluation of interdependencies between cryptocurrencies and other financial assets.
  
2. Machine Learning Application
   
We apply various machine learning techniques to predict future price movements of cryptocurrencies:

- Random Forest Classifier (Baseline-Model): To classify price direction based on historical trends.
- Linear Regression: To understand the impact of various predictors on cryptocurrency prices.
- LSTM Model for Bitcoin: A specialized model for predicting Bitcoin prices using time series data.

3. Conclusion
We compile our findings to discuss the effectiveness of different models and methodologies, providing insights into the potential future behavior of the cryptocurrency market.

**Special Topics of Analysis**

- Volatility: Comparative analysis of the volatility levels among chosen cryptocurrencies.
Social Media & Sentiment: Exploratory work on incorporating sentiment analysis from social media to assess its impact on market trends, despite challenges in accessing data.
Correlation & Risk: An examination of how cryptocurrencies correlate with traditional financial assets and the implications for risk management and investment diversification.
Machine Learning Models Used

- Random Forest: Classification of trend directions.
Linear Regression: Predictive analysis of price based on multiple factors.
LSTM: Advanced predictive model focusing on Bitcoin price trends.

**Key Questions Addressed**
- What key trends are evident in the historical price movements of the selected cryptocurrencies?
- How effectively can our machine learning models predict cryptocurrency prices?
- What are the relative volatility levels of these cryptocurrencies compared to each other and traditional financial assets?
- How can external data, like sentiment analysis from social media, enhance our forecasting accuracy?
- What are the correlation patterns between these cryptocurrencies and traditional asset classes?
- By exploring these questions, our project aims to offer a comprehensive view of the cryptocurrency marketâ€™s interactions with traditional financial systems and to highlight potential investment opportunities and risks.
